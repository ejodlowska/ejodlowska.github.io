About My Work
=============

I am a professional meeting planner. Currently, I work for the Python Software Foundation as an event planner
for PyCon and also an administrator for the foundation. 

I am a recent member of PCMA and a volunteer for their Northern Californian Chapter.

In some ways, I am pretty lucky as I get to work from home. Basically that means, I can work from anywhere 
that has decent internet connection! 

In some ways, my job is challenging. Any meeting planner knows that the job is stressful. I believe, in my position, 
there is an additional layer of challenge due to the PSF being a volunteer run association.  The conference I oversee 
yearly, is also volunteer run.  Every year becomes a learning experience for me.  

With the PSF being a non for profit organization, our budget is small so we do try to cut corners where we can. Luckily, 
we have very dedicated volunteers who come to help with onsite year after year.

My first experience with PyCon was in 2008 in Chicago. This was while I worked for a registration company in Illinois, 
which is where I first started with meeting planning.  I have been involved with PyCon ever since and my role has 
progressed over the years. I started with simple negotiations, room setup, and F&B guarantees. That has evolved quite 
a bit. At this point, I am the single consistency for PyCon over the years and I help carry on all of the knowledge.

In the most recent years, the most challenging has been to learn how to work smart. Figuring out how to do that when 
some of the volunteer turnover is quite difficult.  If you have any input/advice, please contact me! I'd love to hear it.
